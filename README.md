# Sleep Study Analysis

This project is part of a **Probability and Statistics** course and aims to analyze trends in **cognitive reaction time** based on:

1. **Sleep deprivation time** (keeping the subject constant), and
2. **Subjects** (keeping the number of days constant).

## Observations

- The **former trend** (reaction time vs. sleep deprivation time) is **moderately strong**.
- The **latter trend** (reaction time vs. subjects) is **quite weak**, as expected.

## Distribution Analysis

- The **reaction time vs. sleep deprivation** follows an **increasing exponential distribution**, aligning with our expectations.
- The **reaction time vs. subjects** follows a **weak gamma distribution**, providing limited insights.

## Conclusion

- The study reinforces the notion that **adequate sleep is crucial for maintaining cognitive function**.
- However, the insights are constrained by the **small dataset** used in the study.
